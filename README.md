# Gravitational Waves Detection

According to popular scientific theories the universe is said to consist of 4-dimensions ( 3 space
co-ordinates and a time co-ordinate). It states that space and time are interlinked together to form a
space-time continuum. Here the universe is said to be a space-time fabric and that mass bends
space-time. If mass bends space-time, then mass under acceleration must create ripples, or waves, in
space-time. A massive object moving through space-time will create waves that ripple out across the
Universe. These are gravitational waves. Every object in the universe that has mass and accelerates in
space-time produces gravitational waves. These waves from even massive black holes are almost
undetectable with the current technology that exists because of those existing at a vast distance. On 11
February 2016 it was announced that the LIGO collaboration had directly observed gravitational waves
for the first time in September 2015. The second observation of gravitational waves was made on 26
December 2015 and announced on 15 June 2016. LIGOâ€™s two four-kilometre-long arms are arranged in
an L-shape, so, as a wave passes through, one arm is lengthened and the other shortened. Although the
prediction was made 100 years ago, it is only recently that equipment is sensitive enough to detect
them. Not only is the effect tiny, the signal is so weak it could be overwhelmed by something as trivial
as a person dropping a cricket ball near LIGO's mirrors. There are lots of things that can interfere with detection or create a false signal. Detection of these waves is a complex process that requires highly sensitive massive equipment. DL/ML techniques could be effective in dealing with recognizing the
patterns and other external characteristics of gravitational waves. The data set comprises time series
data containing simulated gravitational wave measurements from a network of 3 gravitational wave
interferometers (LIGO Hanford, LIGO Livingston, and Virgo). Each time series contains either detector
noise or detector noise plus a simulated gravitational wave signal. The model should be capable of
detecting gravitational waves if present in the signals using deep learning techniques and analyse certain characteristics of the waves.
